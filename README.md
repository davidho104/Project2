# Jump-Start Bot


<hr>


Concept: JUMP-START – A training program for your first day at work that will provide a series a challenges to test how well you absorbed your orientation. Designed to relieve first-day jitters, the app functions as a game with timers and scores. The player will provide text based responses to a chat bot, and will have an opportunity to ask questions about those topics. Each time an employee completes the challenges they can compare their scores with previous players. Employers can see which questions each employee got right.

What is in MYSQL?: The questions, the answers, the accounts of each player, the scores and times of each attempt.
